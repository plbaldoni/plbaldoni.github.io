## Bio
 
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Smyth Lab](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/gordon-smyth/486/gordon-smyth-lab-team) at the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research](https://www.wehi.edu.au/). At the WEHI, most of my research has been focused on the analysis and interpretation of bulk and single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomics data. I enjoy developing new statistical methods and writing efficient bioinformatic tools that can help researchers make sense of their data.

In 2020, I graduated with a PhD in [biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/). During my PhD, I developed statistical methods for the analysis of both bulk and single-cell epigenomic assays. At UNC, I was a graduate researcher in the [Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)](https://sites.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/) and developed/applied statistical methods to analyze data from the HCHS/SOL under complex survey design settings.
